<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>During the early days on the Midwestern frontier, especially
during the War of 1812 and the concurrent Indian
warfare, terror was easily spread through settlements and
villages by rumors of nearby redskins. Raids were frequent,
and the horrors of Indian warfare made even the boldest
men fear for their lives and for the lives of their loved
ones. But even in the midst of danger, a practical joke was
not unappreciated. Such was the setting for the following
incident, retold in the INDIANA STATE GAZETTE of November
19, 1829.</p>
<p>The Boards and the Staff of the Public Library of Fort
Wayne and Allen County present this account as an example
of a type of humor found in Midwestern pioneer life. Personal
and place names are spelled as in the original narrative.
Grammar, spelling, and punctuation have been changed
to conform to current usage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<p class="tb">There will be few old residents of Ohio, especially
those who early settled in Knox, Richland, and Franklin
counties and the counties north and west of them, who will
not readily recall to mind the consternation that was frequently
felt in neighborhoods and villages along the frontier
during the eventful year of 1812. The situation of the towns
and settlements in the counties above named was dangerous
owing to their easy access from the Indian villages of
the wild northwestern parts of the state. The inhabitants
were subjected to a kind of border warfare and were exposed
to much depredation and bloodshed.</p>
<p>Both before and after the surrender of our army at
Detroit by General Hull, the Indians received encouragement
and protection from the British forts in Canada. Irritated
by the rapid and progressive encroachment upon their territories
by the enterprising citizens of the states, they made
frequent raids, sometimes firing barns and driving off cattle.
In many instances they massacred or captured whole
families. Bloody scenes of this kind were described daily
by visiting hunters and scouts, and the horrors of the tomahawk
and the scalping knife continually preyed upon the
minds of our wives and children. The relation of these tales
of savage cruelty, the note of preparations for war that then
sounded through all our country, the daily sound of the drum
and fife in our streets, the turning out of volunteers, and
the enrolling of drafted men&mdash;all produced a feverish excitement
in the mind of the public.</p>
<p>In the midst of the general feeling of patriotism that
pervaded the sons of Ohio, we could frequently discover the
thrill of terror as our eyes turned upon home and we thought
of the defenseless situation in which we had left our families.
With these excitements and with such a state of public feeling,
slight appearances of danger were frequently sufficient
to throw a whole neighborhood or village into a state of consternation.</p>
<p>On a fine afternoon in the month of May, 1812, a number
of neighbors had assembled to assist at a logrolling on
a farm a little south of the now flourishing town of Mount
Vernon. The dangers with which they were surrounded and
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the fears and apprehensions that the Indians might make a
descent upon the settlement became common subjects of conversation
with them. And as the whisky was freely circulated
and the men&rsquo;s blood became warmed, there arose some
fine bursts of patriotism and boasts of personal bravery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me but see the moccasin track of an Indian near
Mount Vernon,&rdquo; said Archibald Crawford, &ldquo;and damn my
eyes, give me but a good rifle, and I&rsquo;ll soon drive them into
the woods again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay now, Archie Crawford,&rdquo; said another who joined
in the conversation. &ldquo;We ought not to brag too high until we
have been proved. How would your temper stand the welding
heat? Suppose you were attacked by two at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? Why, well, never fear me,&rdquo; rejoined the other.
&ldquo;If my ammunition failed, or if my gun was taken from me,
I&rsquo;d so lay about me with these sledge hammers that they
would soon give up the game. Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,
Emmett: these Indians are not so brave as you think. Besides,
we fight for our country. And damn my eyes, but I
believe that with Captain Walker&rsquo;s Company, I could drive
a regiment of them back to Sandusky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general burst of laughter followed this high-toned
declaration of personal bravery, and the labors of the day
were resumed. Evening at length drew on; and the company,
having taken the parting glass, began to separate. A little
after dusk Archibald Crawford was on his way to Mount Vernon,
where he resided. He crossed Dry Creek just above
its confluence with the waters of Owl Creek, where they form
what is now known as the Vernon River. Whistling the then
familiar tune of &ldquo;White Cockade,&rdquo; he proceeded directly toward
the footbridge that led across Owl Creek into the town.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from behind a clump of sycamores that may
yet be seen near the bank of the creek, two able-bodied red
warriors sprang out and, with the cry of &ldquo;Wah!&rdquo; instantly
seized him. Their language, dress, and accouterments, together
with the general war cry that seemed to be raised in
his ears, confirmed his belief that he was surrounded by
British and Indians. After a few wild screams and some of
the most desperate plunges and struggles that perhaps were
ever made by mortal man, Crawford succeeded in disengaging
himself from the iron grasp of the savages. He had the
advantage of being well acquainted with the ground and the
ford of the river, and his speed soon brought him to the little
collection of houses that then constituted the town of Mount
Vernon.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The inhabitants of this village had been frequently
alarmed by the appearance of Indians in the vicinity. The
town&rsquo;s exposed situation was such that the authorities were
subsequently justified in quartering a small detachment of
soldiers there for protection. The main street is now an
unbroken street more than half a mile in length, lined with
well-built brick and frame houses. The main street was
then only a short street of a small hamlet, lined with wretched,
temporary buildings. The whole military strength of
the county, now forming a full brigade, was then not sufficient
to constitute a regiment; it was formed into a separate,
small battalion under the command of Major Kratzer. But
the military glory and pride of the inhabitants rested in a
fairly well-organized company of riflemen, who wore uniforms
of blue linsey hunting shirts and were commanded by
Captain Joseph Walker, and in an inconsiderable company
of light horsemen under the command of Captain Ankeny.</p>
<p>A small, square log house, standing on the point of a
gentle hill, served as the principal tavern, storehouse,
camp, and garrison. It was a general place of resort for
all the village politicians, and it served as a general place
of refuge when danger approached. Late in the evening a
small party stood about the door of this important mansion,
discussing the signs of the times and the fearful omens of
the great comet, when Archibald Crawford burst in upon
them, pale and breathless.</p>
<p>The terror that was depicted upon his countenance immediately
ran through the whole company. And when they
heard the whole tale of horror, amplified by the eloquence
of excessive fright and confirmed by the oaths and protestations
of Crawford, who swore that he had distinctly smelled
the tawny skins and greasy blankets of the savages who had
attacked him, no pen could describe their consternation.
The thing appeared to be plain. A band of Indians, or perhaps
British and Indians, had taken ambush in the bottom
adjacent to the village and were only waiting for the dead of
night, when they might rush in to plunder and massacre the
defenseless inhabitants. The scalps and prisoners of some
twenty or thirty families would be a rich booty when taken
to Malden, and there was nothing to intercept the return of
the depredators thither. In this conclusion all were agreed.
And it was with sickening horror that the honest villager
contemplated the plight of his family and the distress that
was expected to take place soon.</p>

<p class="pcap">Crawford burst in upon them.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The alarm no sooner became general than the cry of
&ldquo;To garrison! To garrison!&rdquo; passed from house to house;
and in a few moments women and children might be seen
clinging to their husbands, fathers, or brothers, making
their utmost speed along the uneven pathways or streets that
led to the town hall. Here might be seen all ages of both
sexes&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;stowed into the garrison.
Some were expressing the utmost agony of fear; others
were swelling with patriotism as danger seemed to hover
around them; some were crying; some were laughing; some
were swearing and drinking, reckless of the storm of war.
And some, possessing more nerve and military presence of
mind, were busily employed in mustering the forces of the
town.</p>
<p>The strong and commanding voice of Major Kratzer
was frequently heard, as he calmly and decisively summoned
the strong and able-bodied settlers. These came armed
with rifles, shotguns, cutlasses, old swords, pitchforks,
spears, clubs, and also tomahawks and scalping knives. The
promptitude with which all classes assembled for their common
defense, the roll of the drum and the shrill notes of the
fife, the hoarse cry of &ldquo;To horse!&rdquo; by Captain Ankeny, and
the sound of the tin trumpet&mdash;all had a tendency to dispel the
gloom of the night and to excite in the bosoms of the inhabitants
a sudden gleam of military ardor and confidence in
their safety. Instances of heroic spirit were not wanting
among the females, many of whom, though until recently
unused to the sound of the tocsin, met the approach of danger
with fortitude and a determined spirit of resistance.</p>

<p class="pcap">... clinging to their husbands ...</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The women and children, safely lodged in the garrison,
were left under the protection of the old men and a few
others who were considered unable for harder service; the
rest of the assembled forces scoured the adjacent woods and
kept watch around the village until morning. The Indians
did not make an appearance. Captain Walker, who by this
time had placed himself at the head of his trusty riflemen,
proposed to repair to the scene of the scuffle between Crawford
and the Indians, to pick up their trail, and to pursue
them. As Walker was an old hunter and well acquainted with
the woods and with the habits of the Indians, his proposition
was immediately heeded. The sun had scarcely tinged the
young foliage of the elms and tall sycamores that grow upon
the margin of the stream when the party assembled upon the
spot pointed out by Crawford as the place where he had been
attacked. True, there could not be discovered any remnants
of Indian clothing, nor did the rank grass or beaten path permit
them to discover distinct moccasin tracks. But there
were the most undeniable proofs of a desperate struggle having
taken place there; the buttons torn from Crawford&rsquo;s coat
and other pieces of his dress which were picked up on the
spot confirmed the truth of his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not drive them back to Sandusky, Archie
Crawford?&rdquo; cooly inquired someone near him. Crawford
turned and discovered Emmett surveying the scene with an
air of carelessness, while a sarcastic smile played upon his
hardy features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have one man drive a whole band of savages?&rdquo;
replied the other, somewhat nettled at the question.
&ldquo;And they armed with rifle, tomahawk, and scalping knife?
A man must not throw away his life at a time when his country
may have need of his assistance.&rdquo; And with this patriotic
remark he turned away.</p>
<p>Not being able to trace the trail of the Indians, the
party returned to the garrison and made a report of their
discoveries. After a hasty breakfast, a council was held.
It was determined that the whole force of the town, or as
many men as could be spared, should be divided into different
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
reconnoitering parties. These groups, taking different directions,
should put the neighboring settlers upon their guard
and should endeavor to discover the retreat of the hostile
party. Accordingly, the military part of the force was divided
into small detachments which took different directions.
They had instructions to return in the evening and make a
report of their discoveries.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the other villagers in small parties
continued to ramble through the woods within the vicinity of
the town, endeavoring to discover some trace of the retreating
party of Indians. As Emmett and another townsman were
strolling through the rich bottoms near a place called the
Indian fields, a little below Mount Vernon on the south side
of the river, the conversation naturally turned upon the incidents
of the preceding night. Emmett turned to his companion
with a hearty laugh, requested him to sit down on a
log nearby, and said he would disclose to him the whole cause
of the alarm. When his companion was seated, Emmett proceeded
to tell him about the logrolling and the boastings of
Crawford as to his personal courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believing that his heart would quail if put to the test,
notwithstanding his pretensions of bravery,&rdquo; continued Emmett,
&ldquo;another man and I entered into conspiracy against
him. Our object was to play a joke upon him and to put his
fortitude to a trial. We accordingly waited until he had
started homeward. Then, having in some small degree disguised
ourselves, and having taken a hasty circuitous route,
we came into the road some distance before him and concealed
ourselves behind the clump of trees on the margin of
Dry Creek. Our plan succeeded beyond our expectation. We
gave the poor fellow a greater fright than was intended. The
joke succeeded so well that when we discovered the course
it was about to take, we determined to enjoy it longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="918" />
<p class="pcap">and he would disclose to him the whole cause of the alarm</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>This disclosure being made, the two enjoyed some
merriment at the expense of Crawford and the deluded villagers.
Then they laid themselves down in the shade to await
the arrival of the appointed time for making their report.
In the evening the different parties returned, bringing the
joyful intelligence that the enemy had certainly fled from
the settlement, as no trace of them could be found. The
inhabitants returned to their places of residence and again
enjoyed peaceful slumber. And it was not until after the
lapse of several weeks that the deception and trick that had
been so successfully played upon Crawford, and, indeed,
upon the whole village, became generally known. But as the
ruse was intended more particularly for one person, and as
the excitement had passed, most of the inhabitants joined in
the enjoyment of the joke. By common consent the affair
was dubbed &ldquo;Crawford&rsquo;s Defeat,&rdquo; under which name the circumstance,
with all the incidents herein related, is yet well
remembered by the old residents of this place.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
